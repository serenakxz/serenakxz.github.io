        <p class="flex">This was the genius of our ancestors, that by <span class="highlight">cutting off the
                light</span> from this empty space they imparted to <span class="highlight">the world of shadows</span>
            that formed there a quality of mystery and depth superior to that of any wall painting or ornament. The
            technique seems simple, but was by no means so simply achieved. We can imagine with little difficulty what
            extraordinary pains were taken with <span class="highlight">each invisible detail</span>-the placement of
            the window in the shelving recess, the depth of the crossbeam, the height of the threshold. But for me the
            most exquisite touch is- <span class="highlight">the pale white glow of the shoji</span> in the study bay; I
            need only pause before it and I forget the passage of time.</p>

        <p class="flex">The study bay, as the name suggests, was originally a projecting window built to provide a place
            for reading. Over the years it came to be regarded as no more than <span class="highlight">a source of
                light</span> for the alcove; but most often it serves not so much to illuminate the alcove as to <span
                class="highlight">soften the sidelong rays</span> from without, to filter them through paper panels.
            There is a cold and desolate tinge to the light by the time it reaches these panels. The little sunlight
            from the garden that manages to make its way beneath the eaves and through the corridors has by then <span
                class="highlight">lost its power to illuminate,</span> seems drained of the complexion of life. It can
            do no more than accentuate the whiteness of the paper. I sometimes linger before these panels and study the
            surface of the paper, bright, but giving no impression of brilliance.</p>
