                <p id="demo1">Of course the Japanese room does have its picture alcove, and in it a hanging scroll and a
                    flower arrangement. But the scroll and the flowers serve not as ornament but rather to <span
                        class="highlight">give depth to the shadows</span>. We value a scroll above all for the way it
                    blends with the walls of the alcove, and thus we consider the mounting quite as important as the
                    calligraphy or painting. Even the greatest masterpiece will lose its worth as a scroll if it fails
                    to blend with the alcove, while a work of no particular distinction may blend beautifully with the
                    room and set off to unexpected advantage both itself and its surroundings. Wherein lies the power of
                    an otherwise ordinary work to produce such an effect? Most often the paper, the ink, the fabric of
                    the mounting will possess a certain look of antiquity, and this look of antiquity will strike just
                    the right balance with <span class="highlight">the darkness of the alcove and room</span>.

                    </br> We have all had the experience, on a visit to one of the great temples of Kyoto or Nara, of
                    being shown a scroll, one of the temple's treasures, hanging in a large, deeply recessed alcove. So
                    <span class="highlight">dark</span> are these alcoves, even in <span class="highlight">bright
                        daylight</span>, that we can hardly discern the outlines of the work; all we can do is listen to
                    the explanation of the guide, follow as best we can the all-but invisible brush strokes, and tell
                    ourselves how magnificent a painting it must be. Yet the combination of that blurred old painting
                    and the dark alcove is one of absolute harmony. The lack of clarity, far from disturbing us, seems
                    rather to suit the painting perfectly.

                    </br> For the painting here is nothing more than another delicate surface upon which <span
                        class="highlight">the faint, frail light</span> can play; it performs precisely the same
                    function as the sand-textured wall. This is why we attach such importance to age and patina. A new
                    painting, even one done in ink monochrome or subtle pastels, can quite <span
                        class="highlight">destroy the shadows of an alcove</span>, unless it is selected with the
                    greatest care.

                <p id="demo2">A Japanese room might be likened to <span class="highlight">an inkwash
                        painting</span>, the paper-paneled shoji being the expanse where the ink is thinnest, and the
                    alcove <span class="highlight">where it is darkest</span>. Whenever I see the alcove of a tastefully
                    built Japanese room, I marvel at our comprehension of <span class="highlight">the secrets of
                        shadows</span>, our sensitive use of <span class="highlight">shadow and light</span>. For the
                    beauty of the alcove is not the work of some clever device. An empty space is marked off with plain
                    wood and plain walls, so that the light drawn into it <span class="highlight">forms dim shadows
                        within emptiness.</span> There is nothing more. And yet, when we <span class="highlight">gaze
                        into the darkness</span> that gathers behind the crossbeam, around the flower vase, beneath the
                    shelves, though we know perfectly well <span class="highlight">it is mere shadow,</span> we are
                    overcome with the feeling that in this small corner of the atmosphere there reigns complete and
                    utter silence; that here <span class="highlight">in the darknes</span> immutable tranquility holds
                    sway. The "mysterious Orient" of which Westerners speak probably refers to the uncanny silence of
                    these dark places. And even we as children would feel an inexpressible chill as we peered into the
                    depths of an alcove to which the sunlight had never penetrated. Where lies the key to this mystery?
                    illtimately it is the magic of shadows. Were the shadows to be banished from its comers, the alcove
                    would in that instant revert to <span class="highlight">mere void.</span></p>

                <p id="demo3">This was the genius of our ancestors, that by <span class="highlight">cutting off the
                        light</span> from this empty space they imparted to <span class="highlight">the world of
                        shadows</span> that formed there a quality of mystery and depth superior to that of any wall
                    painting or ornament. The technique seems simple, but was by no means so simply achieved. We can
                    imagine with little difficulty what extraordinary pains were taken with <span class="highlight">each
                        invisible detail</span>-the placement of the window in the shelving recess, the depth of the
                    crossbeam, the height of the threshold. But for me the most exquisite touch is- <span
                        class="highlight">the pale white glow of the shoji</span> in the study bay; I need only pause
                    before it and I forget the passage of time.</br>
                    The study bay, as the name suggests, was originally a projecting window built to provide
                    a place for reading. Over the years it came to be regarded as no more than <span class="highlight">a
                        source of light</span> for the alcove; but most often it serves not so much to illuminate the
                    alcove as to <span class="highlight">soften the sidelong rays</span> from without, to filter them
                    through paper panels. There is a cold and desolate tinge to the light by the time it reaches these
                    panels. The little sunlight from the garden that manages to make its way beneath the eaves and
                    through the corridors has by then <span class="highlight">lost its power to illuminate,</span> seems
                    drained of the complexion of life. It can do no more than accentuate the whiteness of the paper. I
                    sometimes linger before these panels and study the surface of the paper, bright, but giving no
                    impression of brilliance.
