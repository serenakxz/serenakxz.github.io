                <p id="demo1">I possess no specialized knowledge of architecture, but I understand that in the Gothic
                    cathedral of the West, the roof is thrust up and up so as to place its pinnacle as high in the
                    heavens as possible-and that herein is thought to lie its special beauty. In <span
                        id="highlight">the temples of Japan</span>, on the other hand, a roof of heavy tiles is first
                    laid out, and in the <span id="highlight">deep, spacious shadows </span> created by the eaves the
                    rest of the structure is built. Nor is this true only of temples; in the palaces of the nobility and
                    the houses of the common people, what first strikes the eye is massive roof of tile or thatch and
                    <span class="highlight">the heavy darkness that hangs beneath the eaves</span>. Even at <span
                        id="highlight">midday cavernous darkness</span> spreads over all beneath the roof's edge, making
                    entryway, doors, walls, and pillars all but invisible. The grand temples of Kyoto-Chion'in,
                    Honganji-and the farmhouses of the remote countryside are alike in this respect: like most buildings
                    of the past their roofs give the impression of possessing far greater weight, height, and surface
                    than all that stands beneath the eaves. </p>

                <p id="demo2">In making for ourselves a place to live, we first spread a parasol to <span
                        id="highlight">throw a shadow on the earth</span>, and in <span id="highlight">the pale light of
                        the shadow</span> we put together a house. There are of course roofs on Western houses too, but
                    they are less to keep off the sun than to keep off the wind and the dew; even from without it is
                    apparent that they are built to create <span id="highlight">as few shadows as possible</span> and to
                    expose the interior to as much light as possible. If the roof of a Japanese house is a parasol, the
                    roof of a Western house is no more than a cap, with as small a visor as possible so as to <span
                        id="highlight">allow the sunlight to penetrate</span> directly beneath the eaves. There are no
                    doubt all sorts of reasons-climate, building materials-for the deep Japanese eaves. The fact that we
                    did not use glass, concrete, and bricks, for instance, made a low roof necessary to keep off the
                    driving wind and rain. <span id="highlight">A light room</span> would no doubt have been more
                    convenient for us, too, than <span id="highlight">a dark room</span>. The quality that we call
                    beauty, however, must always grow from the realities of life, and our ancestors, forced to live in
                    dark rooms, presently came to <span id="highlight">discover beauty in shadows</span>, ultimately to
                    guide shadows towards beauty's ends.</p>

        <div class="paraThree">
            <a href="content3.html">
                <p id="demo3">And so it has come to be that the beauty of a Japanese room depends on <span
                        id="highlight">a variation of shadows</span>, <span id="highlight">heavy shadows against light
                        shadows</span>-it has nothing else. Westerners are amazed at the simplicity of Japanese rooms,
                    perceiving in them no more than ashen walls bereft of ornament. Their reaction is understandable,
                    but it betrays a failure to comprehend <span id="highlight">the mystery of shadows</span>. Out
                    beyond the sitting room, which <span id="highlight">>the rays of the sun</span> can at best but
                    barely reach, we extend the eaves or build on a veranda, putting <span id="highlight">the sunlight
                        at still greater a remove</span>. The light from the garden steals in but dimly through
                    paper-paneled doors, and it is precisely this <span id="highlight">indirect light</span> that makes
                    for us the charm of a room. We do our walls in neutral colors so that <span id="highlight">the sad,
                        fragile, dying rays </span>can sink into absolute repose. The storehouse, kitchen, hallways, and
                    such may have a glossy finish, but the walls of the sitting room will almost always be of day
                    textured with fine sand. A luster here would destroy <span id="highlight">the soft fragile beauty of
                        the feeble light</span>. We delight in the mere sight of <span id="highlight">>the delicate glow
                        of fading rays</span> clinging to the surface of a dusky wall, there to live out what little
                    life remains to them. We never tire of the sight, for to us this pale glow and <span
                        id="highlight">these dim shadows</span> far surpass any ornament. And so, as we must if we are
                    not to disturb the glow, we finish the walls with sand in a single neutral color. The hue may differ
                    from room to room, but the degree of difference will be ever so slight; not so much a difference in
                    color as in shade, a difference that will seem to exist only in the mood of the viewer. And from
                    these delicate differences in the hue of the walls, the shadows in each room take on a tinge
                    peculiarly their own.</p>
