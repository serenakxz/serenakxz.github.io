        Serena: Let’s turn to some questions about
your school life. So why do you choose to
study in Illustration at Parsons?</br></br>
Caitlin: I feel like this question can’t answer
the answer in two parts. Firstly, why I chose

to study illustrations and why I came to Par-
sons. I chose to study illustration because I

love expressing myself. As I said before, I’m
an overly emotional and imaginative person.
And besides that, I feel like illustration is like
the art of storytelling. And I got like when I
was young, I was really into in reading manga
and comic books such as Bleach and Zhiyin
-
Manke from China. I don’t know if you read it
before. And I imagine myself, being in these
stories. And after a while, I started trying to
create my own stories like listening to music.
I would imagine it being like an intro to my
anime. And I feel like that really got me into,
like, illustration. Oh, and also I love drawing,
too. So, yeah, that’s advantageous for me.
And besides that, I can’t do passes because
I feel like it’s a perfect combination of being
experimental and having real-life applica
-
tions. The professors really taught me how to

like how to use my illustrations in the mar-
ket. And I remember one professor, George

Bates from last semester. He told me, like,
if you draw illustration, you probably can’t
make that much money. But if you write your
stories, like if published children’s book, you
write your stories and draw illustrations and
editors and you can make a lot of money.</br></br>
Serena: Now let’s move on. The second
question is, what’s your favorite class so far?
Since you have already been a sophomore.</br></br>
Caitlin: I have two favorite courses. The
first one being comic theory and practice
in the first year, because this course, real
-
ly... Because I have always been interested
in comics, my dream is to publish a graphic
novel. And this course really helped me open
the gates of comics and graphic narratives.
And my second favorite course-- anatomy and
perspective from last semester, which is an
online semester. Although it is like online, I
managed to produce a lot of works that are
suitable to go into my portfolio, which I’ll show right now. It is my website. For exam
-
ple, this comic I produced in class. And also
this comic. And also this comic, so I feel like
this class really gave us a lot of freedom for
us to produce works. Like Professor Gavin
Spilman, he gave us a prompt and he would
just urge us to produce our personal work.
And afterward, he will critique it and help us
improve it. I really like the format.</br></br></div>
<div>
Serena: That’s super cool. I love your work.
I think the website is amazing. So let’s talk
about online classes, like your anatomy draw
-
ing class. So how is online learning so far?
And I think it might continue or not, what is
your point on it?</br></br>
Caitlin: I feel like the online learning ex
-
perience has been it’s been positive for me
because I’m very lucky. I have family mem
-
bers in the US. I’m currently studying in
Princeton, New Jersey. Not in the university,
but study at home, and at least I don’t have to
wake up in the middle of the night to do my
classes, which I feel like I’m very lucky. But
and other than that, I study illustration. So I
feel like a lot of illustrations can be done dig
-
itally and I have most of the materials to do
so. So yeah, it’s been OK for me. But again,
I miss all my peers. I miss study at Parsons

and miss interacting with people at the Par-
sons Cafe.</br></br>
