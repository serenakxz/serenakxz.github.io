        <div id="paragraph">Many of us have a sense that sleep and emotions interact in some meaningful kind of way.
            It's perhaps that idea of a parent holding a child. And the child is crying, and they look at you and they
            say, well, they just didn't sleep well last night, as if there's some universal parental wisdom that bad
            sleep the night before equals bad mood and emotion reactivity the next day. But exactly how does a lack of
            sleep impact our emotional brain? And as a consequence, our emotional integrity?
            <br>
            <br>
            Sleep has been shown to target the consolidation of specific aspects of emotional experiences, as well as
            mediate the extinction of human fear feelings.
            <br>
            <br> When we looked at that deep emotional center, the amygdala, what we found is that in those people who
            had
            had a full night of sleep, there was a nice, controlled, modest degree of reactivity. . It wasn't as though
            there was no reactivity at all, but there was an appropriate degree of a response. But in those people who
            were sleep deprived, the amygdala had become hyperreactive. In fact, the amygdala was almost 60% more
            responsive under conditions of a lack of sleep. But why was the deep emotional center so erratic-- so
            sensitive without sleep?
            <br>
            <br>
            It is discovered that there was another part of the brain that was involved. This part of the brain sits
            directly above your eyes, and it's called
            the prefrontal cortex. And it's a part of the brain that's perhaps most evolved in us human beings. It's
            thought to be sort of the CEO of the brain. It's very good at making high-level, executive, top-down control
            decisions and reactions. And one of the things that it regulates is this deep emotional center-- the
            amygdala.
            <br>
            <br>
            Now, when we looked at those people who'd had a full night of sleep, there was a nice, strong communication
            pathway from the prefrontal cortex down to the amygdala, regulating it. But in those people who were sleep
            deprived, that connection had essentially been severed, as it were. And so now, without sleep, we become all
            emotional accelerator pedal, and too little regulatory control brake, as it were. In fact, we're now finding
            significant relationships
            between sleep disruption and disorders such as depression, anxiety, including PTSD, schizophrenia, and most
            recently and tragically, suicide as well. Therefore, here are some tips for good sleep.
            <br>
            <br>
            <li>Go to sleep at the same time each night, and get up at the same time each morning, even on the weekends.
            </li>
            <li>Don't take naps after 3 p.m, and don't nap longer than 20 minutes.</li>
            <li>Stay away from caffeine and alcohol late in the day.</li>
            <li>Avoid nicotine completely.</li>
            <li>Get regular exercise, but not within 2-3 hours of bedtime.</li>
            <li>Don't eat a heavy meal late in the day. A light snack before bedtime is OK.</li>
            <li>Make your bedroom comfortable, dark, quiet, and not too warm or cold.</li>
            <li>Make your bedroom comfortable, dark, quiet, and not too warm or cold.</li>
            <li>Follow a routine to help you relax before sleep (for example, reading or listening to music). Turn off
                the TV and other screens at least an hour before bedtime.</li>
            <li>Don’t lie in bed awake. If you can’t fall asleep after 20 minutes, do something calming until you feel
                sleepy, like reading or listening to soft music.</li>
            <li>Talk with a doctor if you continue to have trouble sleeping.</li>
