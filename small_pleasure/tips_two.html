        <div id="paragraph">We’ve all heard it before, exercise makes people happy! The runner’s high – that feeling of
            happiness that keeps people running and training for marathons. That special energy you get after working
            out in a group or alone. Even the movie Legally Blonde references happiness from exercise endorphins! But is
            it real or just a myth?
            <br>
            <br>
            One aspect of life that can greatly impact your overall sense of happiness and well-being is stress. Stress
            can dampen your mood and lead to increased risk of illness.2 There is good news: Exercise is one of the best
            ways to combat stress!
            <br>
            <br> According to research, exercise has many benefits including decreased risk of depression, improved
            health status and improved reports of happiness.1 Concurrently, a sedentary lifestyle has been associated
            with many poor health outcomes.3
            <br>
            <br>
            When we exercise, the body releases chemicals that boost your sense of well-being and suppress hormones that
            cause stress and anxiety.1 Among the chemicals released are endorphins, serotonin, and dopamine
            neurotransmitters which are related to pain and depression emotions.3 Exercise also reduces hormone activity
            of adrenalin and cortisol which promote feelings of anxiety and tension.3
            <br>
            <br>
            You do not need to participate in demanding physical activity to reap the benefits of exercise. Walking,
            stretching and low-level strength training can all be effective in combatting stress and anxiety. Studies
            have shown that more physical activity throughout the day has been linked to individuals who report feeling
            happier. Here are some Easy Ways to Increase Physical Activity Throughout Your Day
            <br>
            <br>
            <li>Park in the back of the parking lot so you have to walk further to the store
            </li>
            <li>Take the stairs instead of the elevator</li>
            <li>Take your dog for a walk</li>
            <li>Search your area for local bike trails, kayak locations or hiking paths</li>
            <li>Take a day trip to a local park for a walk</li>
            <li>Go for a family bike ride</li>
            <li>Find a workout partner</li>
            <li>Walk up and down the sidelines of your children’s sporting games instead of sitting in the bleachers.
            </li>
            <li>Walk the golf course instead of driving a cart</li>
            <br>
            Physical activity is a great way to decrease stress and improve your overall mood and happiness. The key
            point of doing more physical activity is to find something you enjoy!
