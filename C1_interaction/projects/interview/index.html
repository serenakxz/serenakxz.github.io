<!--Q&A-->
     <div class="question-container">
      <!--Q1!-->
         <div class="question">When did your interest in visual arts begin? When did you realize that you wanted to pursue visual arts in college?</div>
         <br>
         <br>
         <div class="answer">I’ve always had an interest in art since elementary school, but it was never my “defining” hobby. I would take very informal classes in my town after school and in between sport practices (I did gymnastics for a couple years). I would say I knew I wanted to pursue art in college in my sophomore year of highschool. At the time I was in public school and just overall unhappy. They only offered a few art classes that weren’t very advanced, so my sophomore year I transferred to a boarding school for the arts. </div>

      <!--Q2!-->
         <div class="question">Who is your favorite artist? How is this artist special to you?</div>
         <br>
         <br>
         <div class="answer">I don’t know too many artists in the communication design world but I really like Nicole Mclaughlin. Her work focuses around upcycling and repurposing disregarded clothes. I did a research paper and project based on her for my studio/seminar class last fall and I would say that she was my main influence to start upcycling my own clothes. Then, her work had a great balance between creativity and functionality, similar to how communication design is actually. She did a lot of shoes from jacket pockets, shorts from cut up sweatshirts or beanies, etc. Now her work is more conceptual and more playful--- she recently did a croc and jibbet series which was fun, and she just posted a bra she made from lemon juicers-- I still like it, but it’s just not as wearable obviously. </div>

      <!--Q3!-->
         <div class="question">You said you love textiles. When did your fascination with sewing and embroidery begin?</div>
         <br>
         <br>
         <div class="answer">Similar to how my general interest in art was always present, that goes the same with my exposure to textiles. My mom has sewn and knit for most of her life, and she now has her own business on etsy. Throughout my childhood she would always knit me sweaters and I would watch as she would hem my sisters pants, etc. </div>

      <!--Q4!-->
         <div class="question">What did you pick up from working with fabrics?</div>
         <br>
         <br>
         <div class="answer">I think the main and most important thing that I learned from working with fabric is how things are constructed. When I first started, I was so confused as to how the shape of pattern pieces fit together to create the shirt, bag, or whatever I was making. But I think learning and understanding that has really helped me grow in terms of problem solving and noticing patterns/relationships between things.  </div>
         <br>
         <br>
         <br>
         <br>
      <!--Q5!-->
         <div class="question">You have used both fabric and paints in many of your artworks. How do you define the differences between these mediums and what is your preference?</div>
         <br>
         <br>
         <div class="answer">Technically speaking, paint is a medium used for 2D work while fabric is typically used for 3D. However I actually think that there are many overlaps between these two mediums. Depending on how you see it, you can use fabric and textiles as a form of paint or 2D medium, and the texture of fabric can influence how you work with the paint--if that makes any sense. Embroidery is a great example because it is drawing and illustrating using colored threads as your drawing medium. It’s hard to say what my preference would be since I enjoy combining these mediums, but if I were to pick one, I would say fabric and sewing because it’s something that can be and is supposed to be touched/worn, not just admired from a distance like painting is. </div>

         <div class="question">What is your favorite piece on your website? How does it represent you as an artist or designer?</div>
         <br> 
         <br>
         <div class="answer">I’m really proud of the “Don’ts” book I made for my time final this spring. I think that it has the perfect combination of textile use and storytelling. I realized a lot of my work is influenced by memories and nostalgia from my childhood, and this book is about the irrational fears that my mom has ingrained in me and my siblings.</div>

      <!--Q7!-->
         <div class="question">I can feel a strong sense of personal voice in your work. What do you believe inspires your creations?</div>
         <br>
         <br>
         <div class="answer">I briefly said it in the last question, but in the past year or two I realized that a lot of my art is inspired by my own life. I recall certain memories and funny stories are told when my family or friends get together that spark some kind of idea for an art project. I’m not sure if that will be the case as I do more digital and typography work but I still bring in ideas related to that or textiles. We had to choose and design mantras for studio and I chose “The Resistance is Handmade.” </div>

      <!--Q8!-->
         <div class="question">You are studying communication design and you are interested in textiles. How do you visualize your future career?</div>
         <br> 
         <br>
         <div class="answer">I’m not sure what exactly I want to do for my future career. As you’ve probably gathered, I have more knowledge of say, a fashion major than a communication design one, but I think that comm d is really fascinating and important, as it guides how we view and perceive most things. I’m hoping that by the end of this year I will have a better idea of what I want to study further within communication design, and keep my interest in textiles as a separate hobby and stress reliever--maybe with some overlaps here and there. </div>

      <!--Q9!-->
         <div class="question">Would you like to be named as a designer or an artist? How do you see the differences between these two titles?</div>
         <br> 
         <br>
         <div class="answer"> I think most people associate artists with fine art and creating things that are seen in galleries/museums, and designers more as problem solvers and working with companies and brands. I think I would name myself more of a designer rather than an artist, just because of how I think through things and how my artistic process is. </div>

         <div class="question">Last but not least, what is your favorite quote?</div>
         <br>
         <br>
         <div class="answer">To bring it full circle, something Nicole Mclaughin asks herself when she is creating is, “What can we do with what's already there?” I think this can apply not just to upcycling, but art in general because it is so hard to come up with something that is 100% original. Nowadays, everything has already been done, so rather than come up with something entirely new, how can you let past things influence what you do with your work now? How can you re envision what has already been done, so it is authentic to you?
