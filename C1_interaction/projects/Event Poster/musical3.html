       Dear Evan Hansen is a stage musical with music and lyrics by Benj Pasek and </br>
       Justin Paul, and book by Steven Levenson.</br>
       The musical opened on Broadway at the Music Box Theatre in December 2016,</br>
      mafter its world premiere at the Arena Stage in Washington, D.C., in July 2015 </br>
      and an Off-Broadway production at Second Stage Theatre from March to May 2016.</br>
       At the 71st Tony Awards, it was nominated for nine awards, winning six, including </br>
       Best Actor in a Musical for Ben Platt, Best Featured Actress in a Musical for </br>
       Rachel Bay Jones, Best Musical, and Best Score.</br>
       The musical has its origins in an incident that took place during Pasek's </br>
       high school years at Friends' Central School. The musical "...takes the notion </br>
       of a teenager, Platt's Evan Hansen, who invents an important role for himself </br>
       in a tragedy that he did not earn."</br>
