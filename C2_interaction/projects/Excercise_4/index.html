        <p> It is a ceramic mug which my father gained as a souvenir from his company. Since this semester, I have
          always put it on my desk while studying to keep me hydrated. It often contains water and coffee. The mug has a
          dark blue glaze outside, while the inside wall is white. </p>

        <p> I like this mug because it is very thick and can prevent heat loss for a relatively long time. Its surface
          seems reflective, and it looks beautiful when the lamp shines on it. Both the color blue and the reflective
          surface make me think of the sun sparkling off the ocean waves.</p>
