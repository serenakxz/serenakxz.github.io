        <p>I possess no specialized knowledge of architecture, but I understand that in the Gothic cathedral of the
            West, the roof is thrust up and up so as to place its pinnacle as high in the heavens as possible-and that
            herein is thought to lie its special beauty. In <span id="highlight1">the temples of Japan</span>, on the
            other hand, a roof of heavy tiles is first laid out, and in the <span id="highlight2">deep, spacious shadows
            </span> created by the eaves the rest of the structure is built. Nor is this true only of temples; in the
            palaces of the nobility and the houses of the common people, what first strikes the eye is massive roof of
            tile or thatch and <span id="highlight3">the heavy darkness that hangs beneath the eaves</span>. Even at
            <span id="highlight4">midday cavernous darkness</span> spreads over all beneath the roof's edge, making
            entryway, doors, walls, and pillars all but invisible. The grand temples of Kyoto-Chion'in, Honganji-and the
            farmhouses of the remote countryside are alike in this respect: like most buildings of the past their roofs
            give the impression of possessing far greater weight, height, and surface than all that stands beneath the
            eaves. </p>
