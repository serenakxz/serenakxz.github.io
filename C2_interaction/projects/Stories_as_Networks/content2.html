        <p id="demo2">In making for ourselves a place to live, we first spread a parasol to <span id="highlight1">throw
                a shadow on the earth</span>, and in <span id="highlight2">the pale light of the shadow</span> we put
            together a house. There are of course roofs on Western houses too, but they are less to keep off the sun
            than to keep off the wind and the dew; even from without it is apparent that they are built to create <span
                id="highlight3">as few shadows as possible</span> and to expose the interior to as much light as
            possible. If the roof of a Japanese house is a parasol, the roof of a Western house is no more than a cap,
            with as small a visor as possible so as to <span id="highlight4">allow the sunlight to penetrate</span>
            directly beneath the eaves. There are no doubt all sorts of reasons-climate, building materials-for the deep
            Japanese eaves. The fact that we did not use glass, concrete, and bricks, for instance, made a low roof
            necessary to keep off the driving wind and rain. <span id="highlight5">A light room</span> would no doubt
            have been more convenient for us, too, than <span id="highlight6">a dark room</span>. The quality that we
            call beauty, however, must always grow from the realities of life, and our ancestors, forced to live in dark
            rooms, presently came to <span id="highlight7">discover beauty in shadows</span>, ultimately to guide
            shadows towards beauty's ends.</p>
