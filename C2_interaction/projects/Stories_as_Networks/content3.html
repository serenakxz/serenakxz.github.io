        <p id="demo3">And so it has come to be that the beauty of a Japanese room depends on <span id="highlight1">a
                variation of shadows</span>, <span id="highlight2">heavy shadows against light shadows-</span>it has
            nothing else. Westerners are amazed at the simplicity of Japanese rooms, perceiving in them no more than
            ashen walls bereft of ornament. Their reaction is understandable, but it betrays a failure to comprehend
            <span id="highlight3">the mystery of shadows</span>. Out beyond the sitting room, which <span
                id="highlight4">the rays of the sun</span> can at best but barely reach, we extend the eaves or build on
            a veranda, putting <span id="highlight5">the sunlight at still greater a remove</span>. The light from the
            garden steals in but dimly through paper-paneled doors, and it is precisely this <span
                id="highlight6">indirect light</span> that makes for us the charm of a room. We do our walls in neutral
            colors so that <span id="highlight7">the sad, fragile, dying rays </span>can sink into absolute repose. The
            storehouse, kitchen, hallways, and such may have a glossy finish, but the walls of the sitting room will
            almost always be of day textured with fine sand. A luster here would destroy <span id="highlight8">the soft
                fragile beauty of the feeble light</span>. We delight in the mere sight of <span id="highlight9">the
                delicate glow of fading rays</span> clinging to the surface of a dusky wall, there to live out what
            little life remains to them. We never tire of the sight, for to us this pale glow and <span
                id="highlight10">these dim shadows</span> far surpass any ornament. And so, as we must if we are not to
            disturb the glow, we finish the walls with sand in a single neutral color. The hue may differ from room to
            room, but the degree of difference will be ever so slight; not so much a difference in color as in shade, a
            difference that will seem to exist only in the mood of the viewer. And from these delicate differences in
            the hue of the walls, the shadows in each room take on a tinge peculiarly their own.</p>
