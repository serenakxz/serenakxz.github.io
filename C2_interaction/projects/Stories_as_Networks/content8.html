        <p id="bgText">And surely you have seen, in the darkness of the innermost rooms of these huge buildings, to
            which sunlight never penetrates, how the gold leaf of a sliding door or screen will pick up a distant
            glimmer from the garden, then suddenly send forth an ethereal glow, a faint golden light cast into the
            enveloping darkness, like the glow upon the horizon at sunset. In no other setting is gold quite so
            exquisitely beautiful. You walk past, turning to look again, and yet again; and as you move away the golden
            surface of the paper glows ever more deeply, changing not in a flash, but growing slowly, steadily brighter,
            like color rising in the face of a giant. Or again you may find that the gold dust of the background, which
            until that moment had only a dull, sleepy luster, will, as you move past, suddenly gleam forth as if it had
            burst into flame.
