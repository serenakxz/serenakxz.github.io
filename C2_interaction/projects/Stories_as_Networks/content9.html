        <p id="bgText">How, in such a dark place, gold draws so much light to itself is a mystery to me. But I see why
            in ancient times statues of the Buddha were gilt with gold and why gold leaf covered the walls of the homes
            of the nobility. Modem man, in his well-lit house, knows nothing of the beauty of gold; but those who lived
            in the dark houses of the past were not merely captivated by its beauty, they also knew its practical value;
            for gold, in these dim rooms, must have served the function of a reflector. Their use of gold leaf and gold
            dust was not mere extravagance. Its reflective properties were put to use as a source of illumination.
            Silver and other metals quickly lose their gloss, but gold retains its brilliance indefinitely to light the
            darkness of the room. This is why gold was held in such incredibly high esteem.
