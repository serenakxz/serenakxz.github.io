        <p class="singleCo">A Japanese room might be likened to <span class="highlight">an inkwash painting</span>, the
            paper-paneled shoji being the expanse where the ink is thinnest, and the alcove <span
                class="highlight">where it is darkest</span>. Whenever I see the alcove of a tastefully built Japanese
            room, I marvel at our comprehension of <span class="highlight">the secrets of shadows</span>, our sensitive
            use of <span class="highlight">shadow and light</span>. For the beauty of the alcove is not the work of some
            clever device. An empty space is marked off with plain wood and plain walls, so that the light drawn into it
            <span class="highlight">forms dim shadows within emptiness.</span> There is nothing more. And yet, when we
            <span class="highlight">gaze into the darkness</span> that gathers behind the crossbeam, around the flower
            vase, beneath the shelves, though we know perfectly well <span class="highlight">it is mere shadow,</span>
            we are overcome with the feeling that in this small corner of the atmosphere there reigns complete and utter
            silence; that here <span class="highlight">in the darknes</span> immutable tranquility holds sway. The
            "mysterious Orient" of which Westerners speak probably refers to the uncanny silence of these dark places.
            And even we as children would feel an inexpressible chill as we peered into the depths of an alcove to which
            the sunlight had never penetrated. Where lies the key to this mystery? illtimately it is the magic of
            shadows. Were the shadows to be banished from its comers, the alcove would in that instant revert to <span
                class="highlight">mere void.</span></p>
