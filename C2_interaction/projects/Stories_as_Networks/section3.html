                <p id="demo1">In temple architecture the main room stands at a considerable distance from the garden; <span class="highlight">so dilute is the
                    light there</span> that no matter what the season, on fair days or cloudy, morning, midday, or evening, the pale,
                    white glow scarcely varies. And <span class="highlight">the shadows</span> at the interstices of the ribs seem strangely immobile, as if
                    dust collected in the corners had become a part of the paper itself. I blink in uncertainty at this
                    <span class="highlight">dreamlike luminescence</span>, feeling as though some misty film were blunting my vision. The light from the pale
                    white paper, powerless to <span class="highlight">dispel the heavy darkness</span> of the alcove, is instead repelled by the darkness,
                    creating a world of confusion where dark and light are indistinguishable. Have not you yourselves sensed a
                    <span class="highlight">difference in the light</span> that suffuses such a room, a rare tranquility not found in ordinary light? Have you
                    never felt a sort of fear in the face of the ageless, a fear that in that room you might lose all
                    consciousness of the passage of time, that untold years might pass and upon emerging you should find you had
                    grown old and gray?
                </p>


        </div>
        <div class="paraTwo">
            <a href="content8.html">
                <p id="demo2">And surely you have seen, <span class="highlight">in the darkness of the innermost rooms</span> of these huge buildings, to
                    which <span class="highlight">sunlight never penetrates,</span> how the gold leaf of a sliding door or screen will pick up a distant
                    glimmer from the garden, then suddenly send forth an ethereal glow, a faint golden light <span class="highlight">cast into the
                    enveloping darkness,</span> like the glow upon the horizon at sunset. In no other setting is gold quite so
                    exquisitely beautiful. You walk past, turning to look again, and yet again; and as you move away the golden
                    surface of the paper glows ever more deeply, changing not in a flash, but growing slowly, <span class="highlight">steadily brighter</span>,
                    like color rising in the face of a giant. Or again you may find that the gold dust of the background, which
                    until that moment had only a dull, sleepy luster, will, as you move past, suddenly gleam forth as if it had
                    burst into flame.</p>

        <div class="paraThree">
            <a href="content9.html">
                <p id="demo3">How, in such <span class="highlight">a dark place,</span> gold draws so much light to itself is a mystery to me. But I see why
                    in ancient times statues of the Buddha were gilt with gold and why gold leaf covered the walls of the homes
                    of the nobility. Modem man, in his well-lit house, knows nothing of <span class="highlight">the beauty of gold;</span> but those who lived
                    in the dark houses of the past were not merely captivated by its beauty, they also knew its practical value;
                    for gold, in these <span class="highlight">dim rooms,</span> must have served the function of <span class="highlight">a reflector</span>. Their use of gold leaf and gold
                    dust was not mere extravagance. Its reflective properties were put to use as <span class="highlight">a source of illumination.</span>
                    Silver and other metals quickly lose their gloss, but gold <span class="highlight">retains its brilliance indefinitely</span> to light the
                    darkness of the room. This is why gold was held in such incredibly high esteem.
